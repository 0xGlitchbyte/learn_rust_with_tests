- [Install Rust](install_rust.md) - Set up environment for productivity.
- [Hello, world](hello_world.md) - Declaring variables, constants, if/else statements, loops, functions, write your first Rust program and write your first test. Sub-test syntax and closures.
- [Primitives](primitives.md) - Further Explore function declaration syntax and learn new ways to improve the documentation of your code.
- [Control Flow](control_flow.md) - Declaring if/else, loops, match, to control the flow of your program.
- [Vectors](vectors.md) - Learn about one of the most used data structures.
- [Ownership and Borrow Checker](ownership_borrow_checker.md) - Learn about ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
- [Structs](structs.md) - Learn about the three struct types: a classic C struct, a tuple struct, and a unit struct..
- [Enums](enums.md) - Learn about how to define and use `enums`.
- [Strings](strings.md) - Learn about the two string types, a string slice (&str) and an owned string (String).
